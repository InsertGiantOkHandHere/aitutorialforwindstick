# This is a small tutorial for my discord bot, windstick
The bot works like an idle game, and there is an ai I made for it.
I was like "Why not let other people make their own ai if they wanted to, that'd be pretty cool"
And so I made this.
# Requires for debugging
Node.js
# Extra info
This is heavily commented code so you know a lot of what's going on,
the least of what I could do with what little I have in this tutorial at the moment.
